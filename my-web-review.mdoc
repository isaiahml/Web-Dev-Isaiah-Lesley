<h1> The Web is simply defined as the universe of global network-accessible information. </h1>

<p> The Web is at once a world-wide broadcasting capability, a mechanism for information dissemination, and a medium for 
collaboration and interaction between individuals and their computers without regard for geographic location. </p>

<p> The web outside of the short technical description above is something has a societal imapct, a cultural impact, and an even bigger
impact than defined in the points prior-- that being mental health. Although I do recognize the importance of having a medium 
for everything imaginable. I think it is also critical for us to recognize the downside to the web. </p>

<p> To conclude the web has some positive and negative affects on society, but has benefits that outwiegh said societal impacts,
and this is leading to cutting edge revolutions from the research available to the masses </p>

<p> From this point I am giving the web a critical rating of 5/10 this comes from the inability or lackadaisical efforts to 
improve upon these mechanisms and make them more user friendly. </p>
